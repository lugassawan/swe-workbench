# Plugin platform decisions — hooks.json wiring

Rulings on `hooks/hooks.json` wiring and what its entries may carry. Recorded here so
they don't have to be re-litigated. Sibling rulings live in the other `docs/decisions-*.md` files (indexed in
`docs/README.md`).

## 1. Hook `if` conditions — considered, not adopted

`.claude-plugin/schemas/plugin.schema.json` defines the command-hook object as `{type, command,
if, shell, timeout, statusMessage, once, async, asyncRewake}`. `if` is documented as *"Permission
rule syntax to filter when this hook runs (e.g. `Bash(git *)`). Only runs if the tool call matches
the pattern."* — it filters a tool-call payload against a pattern; it is not a general-purpose
guard.

Applied to every entry in `hooks/hooks.json`, no `if` buys anything:

| Hook | Event | Why `if` buys nothing |
|---|---|---|
| `bash_guard.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Bash` | `Bash(*)` is exactly redundant with `matcher` |
| `skill_usage_record.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Skill` | `Skill(*)` is exactly redundant with `matcher` |
| `worktree_permission_grant.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Read\|Edit\|Write` | Worktree root is runtime-resolved, not a static path rule |
| `secret_guard.py` | `PreToolUse` / `Write\|Edit` | Same as `worktree_permission_grant.sh` — no static pattern captures "contains a credential" |
| `handoff_guard.py` | `PreToolUse` / `Bash\|Edit\|Write` | Lease ownership is runtime-resolved per worktree, not a static path/pattern rule |
| `skill_autoload_hint.sh` | `PostToolUse` / `Read\|Edit\|Write` | Would need every extension enumerated; a miss silently loses the hint |
| `skill_usage_flush.sh` | `SubagentStop` | No tool call to match against — inert at best, disabling at worst |
| `workflow_resume_hint.sh` ×3 | `SessionStart` | Same — lifecycle events carry no tool call |
| `memory_hint.sh` ×3 | `SessionStart` | Same — lifecycle events carry no tool call |

**Ruling: no `hooks.json` entry may carry an `if` key**, enforced by
`scripts/validate.py:check_hooks_json()`. This is strictly stronger than the two security
controls (`bash_guard.sh`, `secret_guard.py`) that originally motivated the question — every entry
in the table above hits the same failure mode: `if` is one more predicate that can silently
disable a hook (a miss reads as "hook chose not to fire," not as an error) for zero filtering
benefit over what `matcher` already provides or what the script can check for itself at runtime.
